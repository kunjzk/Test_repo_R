# Explanation of scripts used

There are 2 scripts used in this assignment, `run_analysis.R` and `ass_4_functions.R`.

`run_analysis.R` is the main script for this assignment. It contains 5 sections - demarcated by comments - one for each task in the project. The last line of each section creates the dataframe required in the task.

`ass_4_functions.R` contains the necessary (custom) function definitions needed to run the previous script. There are just 2 functions, `read_and_merge_data` and `get_mean_std_indices`, required for the first 2 parts of the assignment. All other code is in `run_analysis.R` as it was simple enough to not need modulariation through functions.
